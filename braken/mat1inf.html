        <p><b>This week, We have Team BDS come out on top winning 3-2 against Oxygen Esports. While Oxygen Esports nearly took it to overtime, Team BDS was able to win in the final round to stope the opponent from gainging a another chance at winning. Oxygen is a lot stronger defensively, if they would have won the offensive round, took it to overtime, they would have had a very strong case for winning the game. Teams BDS was able to prevent all of that.</b></p>
